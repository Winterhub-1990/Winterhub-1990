### Hello, I'm Sr.Full Stack Developer :wave:

- :telescope: I like working on network protocols and applications, particularly distributed ones.
- :computer: I have a wide range of interests in new technologies, from video game graphics to robotics and 3D printing.
- :star: I'm a WebRTC expert and the author of [libdatachannel](https://libdatachannel.org/), a C/C++ WebRTC standalone library.
- :hearts: I'm looking for [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/paullouisageneau) to continue maintaining open-source projects.
- :mailbox: Please find my contact information and résumé on [enjoylife.follower@gmail.com]
- :smile: Pronouns: he/him

Some of my open source projects:

- [libdatachannel]: WebRTC and WebSockets C/C++ standalone library
- [datachannel-wasm]: C++ WebRTC Data Channels and WebSockets for WebAssembly
- [libjuice]: Lightweight UDP Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) library
- [libplum]: Multi-protocol NAT Port Mapping client library
- [node-portmapping]: Node.js bindings for libplum
- [violet]: Lightweight STUN/TURN server
- [boost-asio-gnutls]: GnuTLS wrapper for Boost.Asio

I'm a contributor to [node-datachannel], Node.js bindings for [libdatachannel](https://libdatachannel.org/).

I've also been contributing to [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/), and [libtorrent](https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent), in which I added WebTorrent support. This first native WebTorrent implementation opens exciting possibilities for Peer-to-Peer file exchanges between Web browsers and native clients!

Otherwise, I like working on robots and tinkering with [Minitels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel)! Check out [my blog](https://chapelierfou.org/) :robot:
